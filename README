For portibility, this project has been updated to compile with autotools rather
than the hand-made Makefile, which was compatibile only with UCSC's unix.ic 
system. That system has since been altered and is no longer compatible with 
the old Makefile! The initial commit of the git repository preserves the old,
broken state of the project. For documentation of the project itself, see
project/html/index.html
